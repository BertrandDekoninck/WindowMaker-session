This is a tweaked version of DF-Arc-OSX (see https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1013690/) in order to avoid a bug of gtk3 apps with the compton compositing manager : I've disabled the shadow of windows in the css of the theme in order to avoid a duplicate shadow of theses apps. This is intended to be used with Windowmaker and compton.

There are still some issues though with drop-down menus I'll try to address later.
